AL Extension: Customer Feedback for Business Central Project Requirements Objective Develop a basic AL extension for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (BC) that customizes the system to meet a simple business requirement.

Scenario A fictional company, Contoso Ltd, needs a small extension to enhance their customer management module. The goal is to add a new table, a page, and a small business logic customization.

Detailed Requirements ðŸ“Œ Table Creation Create a new table named Customer Feedback with the following fields:

Feedback ID (Primary Key, Integer, AutoIncrement = Yes) Customer No. (Code[20], Related to Customer Table) Feedback Date (Date) Rating (Integer, range 1â€“5) Comments (Text[250]) ðŸ“Œ Page Creation Create a list page for the Customer Feedback table. The page should allow users to:

View existing feedback entries. Add new feedback entries. Edit or delete existing feedback entries. Include an action to filter feedback by Customer No. and/or Rating. ðŸ“Œ Business Logic Customization Add a validation trigger on the Rating field to ensure it only accepts values
between 1 and 5. Display an error message if the value is outside this range. Add a codeunit that calculates the average rating for a specific customer. Include a procedure that takes the Customer No. as input and returns the average rating. ðŸ“Œ UI Integration Add an action 
to the Customer Card page that opens the Customer Feedback list filtered by the selected customer. ðŸš€ Tech Stack AL Language Business Central VS Code AL Language Extension ðŸ’¡ Notes This project is a simple AL extension designed for learning and demonstration purposes.
